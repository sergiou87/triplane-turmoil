           Triplane Classic - a side-scrolling dogfighting game

Intro
=====

Triplane Classic is a side-scrolling dogfighting game featuring solo
missions and multiplayer mode with up to four players. It is a port of
the original Triplane Turmoil game for DOS and aims to match the
original game exactly so that high scores remain comparable to the
original.

This is a fork of the original port of the game (http://triplane.sourceforge.net/)
but updated to SDL2, so that is easier to port to other platforms.
It also adds support for 4 XInput game controllers instead of only
2 joysticks.

Please read the manual page for information on how to actually play
the game. Also see README.install if you want to build the game from
source code.

Nintendo Switch Port
====================

The Nintendo Switch port has been built using DevkitPro (https://devkitpro.org/)
and libnx (https://github.com/switchbrew/libnx).

The whole game should be playable, controls have been adapted to the
Switch, including the use of the touch screen or the left joystick
and the A button as a mouse to navigate the menus.

The roster is not functional yet, as you cannot input text, so 4
players are created by default, which have assigned the corresponding
gamepad to their player number.

The default controls are:
- Up/Down: left joystick or directional pad
- Guns: Y button
- Bombs: B button
- Roll: X button
- Power: R button
- Exit/back: - button
- Help: + button

These controls cannot be easily changed from inside the game _yet_.

In order to build it for Nintendo Switch, you need to first build
the file fokker.dks:
$ make depend
$ make fokker.dks

Then you can build the game itself for Nintendo Switch:
$ make -f Makefile.switch

You need to put the following files in your SD card:
 / (root)
 |
 |-- switch/
       |
       |-- triplane-turmoil
               |
               |-- triplane-turmoil.nro
               |-- fokker.dks
