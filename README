           Triplane Classic - a side-scrolling dogfighting game

Intro
=====

Triplane Classic is a side-scrolling dogfighting game featuring solo
missions and multiplayer mode with up to four players. It is a port of
the original Triplane Turmoil game for DOS and aims to match the
original game exactly so that high scores remain comparable to the
original.

This is a fork of the original port of the game (http://triplane.sourceforge.net/)
but updated to SDL2, so that is easier to port to other platforms.
It also adds support for 4 XInput game controllers instead of only
2 joysticks.

Please read the manual page for information on how to actually play
the game. Also see README.install if you want to build the game from
source code.
